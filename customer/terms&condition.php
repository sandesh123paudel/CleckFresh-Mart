        We are very delighted that you have shown interest in our enterprise.
        Data protection is of a particularly high priority for the management of
        the CleckFreshMart. The use of the Internet pages of the CleckFreshMart
        is possible without any indication of personal data; however, if a data
        subject wants to use special enterprise services via our website,
        processing of personal data could become necessary. If the processing of
        personal data is necessary and there is no statutory basis for such
        processing, we generally obtain consent from the data subject.
      </p>
      <p>
        The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail
        address, or telephone number of a data subject shall always be in line
        with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance
        with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to the
        CleckFreshMart. By means of this data protection declaration, our
        enterprise would like to inform the general public of the nature, scope,
        and purpose of the personal data we collect, use and process.
        Furthermore, data subjects are informed, by means of this data
        protection declaration, of the rights to which they are entitled.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the controller, the CleckFreshMart has implemented numerous technical
        and organizational measures to ensure the most complete protection of
        personal data processed through this website. However, Internet-based
        data transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so absolute
        protection may not be guaranteed. For this reason, every data subject is
        free to transfer personal data to us via alternative means, e.g. by
        telephone.

          <h3>Definations</h3>
          <p>
            The data protection declaration of the Company Name is based on the
            terms used by the European legislator for the adoption of the
            General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our data protection
            declaration should be legible and understandable for the general
            public, as well as our customers and business partners. To ensure
            this, we would like to first explain the terminology used.

          <p>
            The Internet pages of the Company Name use cookies. Cookies are text
            files that are stored in a computer system via an Internet browser.
            Many Internet sites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a
            so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the
            cookie. It consists of a character string through which Internet
            pages and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser
            in which the cookie was stored. This allows visited Internet sites
            and servers to differentiate the individual browser of the dats
            subject from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A
            specific Internet browser can be recognized and identified using the
            unique cookie ID.
          </p>
          <p>
            By means of a cookie, the information and offers on our website can
            be optimized with the user in mind. Cookies allow us, as previously
            mentioned, to recognize our website users. The purpose of this
            recognition is to make it easier for users to utilize our website.
            The website user that uses cookies, e.g. does not have to enter
            access data each time the website is accessed, because this is taken
            over by the website, and the cookie is thus stored on the user’s
            computer system. Another example is the cookie of a shopping cart in
            an online shop. The online store remembers the articles that a
            customer has placed in the virtual shopping cart via a cookie.

          <h3>Collection of general data and information</h3>
          <p>
            The website of the Company Name collects a series of general data
            and information when a data subject or automated system calls up the
            website. This general data and information are stored in the server
            log files.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, the Company Name analyzes anonymously collected data and
            information statistically, with the aim of increasing the data
            protection and data security of our enterprise, and to ensure an
            optimal level of protection for the personal data we process. The
            anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from
            all personal data provided by a data subject.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Registration on our website</h3>
          <p>
            The data subject has the possibility to register on the website of
            the controller with the indication of personal data. Which personal
            data are transmitted to the controller is determined by the
            respective input mask used for the registration. The personal data
            entered by the data subject are collected and stored exclusively for
            internal use by the controller, and for his own purposes. The
            controller may request transfer to one or more processors (e.g. a
            parcel service) that also uses personal data for an internal purpose
            which is attributable to the controller.
          </p>
          <p>
            By registering on the website of the controller, the IP
            address—assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP) and used by
            the data subject—date, and time of the registration are also stored.
            The storage of this data takes place against the background that
            this is the only way to prevent the misuse of our services, and, if
            necessary, to make it possible to investigate committed offenses.
            Insofar, the storage of this data is necessary to secure the
            controller. This data is not passed on to third parties unless there
            is a statutory obligation to pass on the data, or if the transfer
            serves the aim of criminal prosecution.
          </p>
          <p>
            The registration of the data subject, with the voluntary indication
            of personal data, is intended to enable the controller to offer the
            data subject contents or services that may only be offered to
            registered users due to the nature of the matter in question.
            Registered persons are free to change the personal data specified
            during the registration at any time, or to have them completely
            deleted from the data stock of the controller.
          </p>
          <p>
            The data controller shall, at any time, provide information upon
            request to each data subject as to what personal data are stored
            about the data subject. In addition, the data controller shall
            correct or erase personal data at the request or indication of the
            data subject, insofar as there are no statutory storage obligations.
            The entirety of the controller’s employees are available to the data
            subject in this respect as contact persons.

          <h3>Subscription to our newsletters</h3>
          <p>
            On the website of the Company Name, users are given the opportunity
            to subscribe to our enterprise’s newsletter. The input mask used for
            this purpose determines what personal data are transmitted, as well
            as when the newsletter is ordered from the controller. Company Name
            informs its customers and business partners regularly by means of a
            newsletter about enterprise offers. The enterprise’s newsletter may
            only be received by the data subject if (1) the data subject has a
            valid e-mail address and (2) the data subject registers for the
            newsletter shipping. A confirmation e-mail will be sent to the
            e-mail address registered by a data subject for the first time for
            newsletter shipping, for legal reasons, in the double opt-in
            procedure. This confirmation e-mail is used to prove whether the
            owner of the e-mail address as the data subject is authorized to
            receive the newsletter.
          </p>
          <p>
            The personal data collected as part of a registration for the
            newsletter will only be used to send our newsletter. In addition,
            subscribers to the newsletter may be informed by e-mail, as long as
            this is necessary for the operation of the newsletter service or a
            registration in question, as this could be the case in the event of
            modifications to the newsletter offer, or in the event of a change
            in technical circumstances. There will be no transfer of personal
            data collected by the newsletter service to third parties. The
            subscription to our newsletter may be terminated by the data subject
            at any time. The consent to the storage of personal data, which the
            data subject has given for shipping the newsletter, may be revoked
            at any time. For the purpose of revocation of consent, a
            corresponding link is found in each newsletter. It is also possible
            to unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time directly on the
            website of the controller, or to communicate this to the controller
            in a different way.

        <li>
          <h3>Newsletter-Tracking</h3>
          <p>
            The newsletter of the Company Name contains so-called tracking
            pixels. A tracking pixel is a miniature graphic embedded in such
            e-mails, which are sent in HTML format to enable log file recording
            and analysis. This allows a statistical analysis of the success or
            failure of online marketing campaigns. Based on the embedded
            tracking pixel, the Company Name may see if and when an e-mail was
            opened by a data subject, and which links in the e-mail were called
            up by data subjects. Such personal data collected in the tracking
            pixels contained in the newsletters are stored and analyzed by the
            controller in order to optimize the shipping of the newsletter, as
            well as to adapt the content of future newsletters even better to
            the interests of the data subject. These personal data will not be
            passed on to third parties. Data subjects are at any time entitled
            to revoke the respective separate declaration of consent issued by
            means of the double-opt-in procedure. After a revocation, these
            personal data will be deleted by the controller. The Company Name
            automatically regards a withdrawal from the receipt of the
            newsletter as a revocation.

          <h3>Contact possibility via the website</h3>
          <p>
            The website of the Company Name contains information that enables a
            quick electronic contact to our enterprise, as well as direct
            communication with us, which also includes a general address of the
            so-called electronic mail (e-mail address). If a data subject
            contacts the controller by e-mail or via a contact form, the
            personal data transmitted by the data subject are automatically
            stored. Such personal data transmitted on a voluntary basis by a
            data subject to the data controller are stored for the purpose of
            processing or contacting the data subject. There is no transfer of
            this personal data to third parties. Routine erasure and blocking of
            personal data

        <li>
          <h3>Right of the data subject</h3>
          <p>
            Right of confirmation Each data subject shall have the right granted
            by the European legislator to obtain from the controller the
            confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or
            her are being processed. If a data subject wishes to avail himself
            of this right of confirmation, he or she may, at any time, contact
            any employee of the controller. Right of access Each data subject
            shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain
            from the controller free information about his or her personal data
            stored at any time and a copy of this information. Furthermore, the
            European directives and regulations grant the data subject access to
            the following information: the purposes of the processing; the
            categories of personal data concerned; the recipients or categories
            of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be
            disclosed, in particular recipients in third countries or
            international organisations; where possible, the envisaged period
            for which the personal data will be stored, or, if not possible, the
            criteria used to determine that period; the existence of the right
            to request from the controller rectification or erasure of personal
            data, or restriction of processing of personal data concerning the
            data subject, or to object to such processing; the existence of the
            right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority; where the
            personal data are not collected from the data subject, any available
            information as to their source;
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Legal basis for the processing</h3>
          <p>
            Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing
            operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing
            purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the
            performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as is
            the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for
            the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing
            is based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such
            processing operations which are necessary for carrying out
            pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries
            concerning our products or services. Is our company subject to a
            legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required,
            such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is
            based on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR. In rare cases, the processing of
            personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the
            data subject or of another natural person. This would be the case,
            for example, if a visitor were injured in our company and his name,
            age, health insurance data or other vital information would have to
            be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party.

            The legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third
            party
          </h3>
          <p>
            Where the processing of personal data is based on Article 6(1) lit.
            f GDPR our legitimate interest is to carry out our business in favor
            of the well-being of all our employees and the shareholders.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Period for which the personal data will be stored</h3>
          <p>
            The criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal
            data is the respective statutory retention period. After expiration
            of that period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, as long
            as it is no longer necessary for the fulfillment of the contract or
            the initiation of a contract.

        <li>
          <h3>
            Provision of personal data as statutory or contractual reqirement
          </h3>
          <p>
            We clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by
            law (e.g. tax regulations) or can also result from contractual
            provisions (e.g. information on the contractual partner). Sometimes
            it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the data subject
            provides us with personal data, which must subsequently be processed
            by us. The data subject is, for example, obliged to provide us with
            personal data when our company signs a contract with him or her. The
            non-provision of the personal data would have the consequence that
            the contract with the data subject could not be concluded. Before
            personal data is provided by the data subject, the data subject must
            contact any employee. The employee clarifies to the data subject
            whether the provision of the personal data is required by law or
            contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether
            there is an obligation to provide the personal data and the
            consequences of non-provision of the personal data.

          <h3>Existence of automated descision-making</h3>
          <p>
            As a responsible company, we do not use automatic decision-making or
            profiling. This Privacy Policy has been generated by the Privacy
            Policy Generator of the External Data Protection Officers that was
            developed in cooperation with the Media Law Lawyers from WBS-LAW.
